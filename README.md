# Voxel Terrain

This is the repository for my a voxel terrain generator using the [Godot 3D engine](https://godotengine.org/).  This project was created after I attempted a rendering engine in Java without any dependencies, and wanted to focus on the challenges surrounding interesting terrain, as well as growing my background in C# and game engines.
